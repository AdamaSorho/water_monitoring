	abstract = {Classifying surface cover types and analyzing changes are among the most common applications of remote sensing. One of the most basic classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient, omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies. The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value{\textless}0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission errors by 50{\%} compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25{\%} compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of classification error.},

	abstract = {The normalized difference water index (NDWI) of McFeeters (1996) was modified by substitution of a middle infrared band such as Landsat TM band 5 for the near infrared band used in the NDWI. The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built-up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built-up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built-up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built-up land noise over the NDWI.},

	abstract = {Accurate monitoring of surface water location and extent is critical for the management of diverse water resource phenomena. The multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery is punctuated by missing data due to cloud cover during acquisition times, hindering the assembly of a continuous time series of inundation dynamics. This study investigated whether streamflow volume measurements could be integrated with satellite data to fill gaps in monthly surface water chronologies for the Central Valley region of California, USA, from 1984 to 2015. We aggregated measurements of maximum monthly water extent within each of the study area's 50 8-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watersheds from two Landsat-derived datasets: the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Monthly Water History and the U.S. Geological Survey Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). We calculated Spearman rank correlation coefficients between water extent values in each HUC and streamflow discharge data. Linear regression fits of the water extent/streamflow data pairs with the highest correlations served as the basis for interpolation of missing imagery surface water values on a HUC-wise basis. Results show strong ($\rho$ {\textgreater} 0.7) maximum correlations in 11 (22.4{\%}) and 25 (51.0{\%}) HUCs for the DSWE and JRC time series, respectively, when comparisons were restricted to imagery and gages co-located in each HUC. Strong maximum correlations occurred in 39 (79.6{\%}; DSWE) and 42 (85.7{\%}; JRC) HUCs when imagery was paired with discharge data from any study area gage, providing a solid basis for reconstruction of water extent values. We generated continuous time series of 30+ years in 35 HUCs, demonstrating that this technique can provide quantitative estimates of historical surface water extents and elucidate flooding or drought events over the period of data collection. Results of a non-parametric trend analysis of the long-term time series on an annual, seasonal, and monthly basis varied among HUCs, though most trends indicate an increase in surface water over the past 30 years.},

	abstract = {The Prairie Pothole Region of North America is characterized by millions of depressional wetlands, which provide critical habitats for globally significant populations of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife species. Due to their relatively small size and shallow depth, these wetlands are highly sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic changes, exhibiting inter- and intra-annual inundation dynamics. Moderate-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) alone cannot be used to effectively delineate these small depressional wetlands. By integrating fine spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-temporal (2009–2017) aerial images, we developed a fully automated approach to delineate wetland inundation extent at watershed scales using Google Earth Engine. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify aerial imagery with additional spectral indices to extract potential wetland inundation areas, which were further refined using LiDAR-derived landform depressions. The wetland delineation results were then compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and existing global-scale surface water products to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We tested the workflow on 26 watersheds with a total area of 16,576 km2 in the Prairie Pothole Region. The results showed that the proposed method can not only delineate current wetland inundation status but also demonstrate wetland hydrological dynamics, such as wetland coalescence through fill-spill hydrological processes. Our automated algorithm provides a practical, reproducible, and scalable framework, which can be easily adapted to delineate wetland inundation dynamics at broad geographic scales.},

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors represent an indispensable data source for flood disaster planners and responders, given their ability to image the Earth's surface nearly independently of weather conditions and time of day. The decision by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program to open data from its Sentinel-1 SAR satellites to the public marks the first time global, operational SAR data have been made freely available. Combined with the emergence of cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this development presents a tremendous opportunity to the disaster response community, for whom rapid access to analysis-ready data is needed to inform effective flood disaster response interventions and management plans. Here, we present an algorithm that exploits all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in combination with historical Landsat and other auxiliary data sources hosted on the GEE to rapidly map surface inundation during flood events. Our algorithm relies on multi-temporal SAR statistics to identify unexpected floods in near real-time. Additionally, historical Landsat-based surface water class probabilities are used to distinguish unexpected floods from permanent or seasonally occurring surface water. We assessed our algorithm over three recent flood events using coincident very high- spatial resolution imagery and operational flood maps. Using very high resolution optical imagery, we estimated an area-normalized accuracy of 89.8 ± 2.8{\%} (95{\%} c.i.) over Houston, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, representing an improvement of between 1.6{\%} and 9.8{\%} over flood maps derived from a simple backscatter threshold. Additionally, comparison of our results with SAR-derived Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps following devastating floods in Thessaly, Greece and Eastern Madagascar in January and March 2018, respectively, yielded overall agreement rates of 98.5{\%} in both cases. Importantly, our algorithm was able to ingest hundreds of SAR and optical images served on the GEE to produce flood maps over affected areas within minutes, circumventing the need for time-consuming data download and pre-processing steps. The flexibility of our algorithm will allow for the rapid processing of future open-access SAR data, including data from future Sentinel-1 missions.},

@article{Casal2020,
	abstract = {Optical satellite data is an efficient and complementary method to hydrographic surveys for deriving bathymetry in shallow coastal waters. Empirical approaches (in particular, the models of Stumpf and Lyzenga) provide a practical methodology to derive bathymetric information from remote sensing. Recent studies, however, have focused on enhancing the performance of such empirical approaches by extending them via spatial information. In this study, the relationship between multibeam depth and Sentinel-2 image bands was analyzed in an optically complex environment using the spatial predictor of kriging with an external drift (KED), where its external drift component was estimated: a) by a ratio of log-transformed bands based on Stumpf's model (KED{\_}S) and b) by a log-linear transform based on Lyzenga's model (KED{\_}L). Through the calibration of KED models, the study objectives were: 1) to better understand the empirical relationship between Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite reflectance and depth, 2) to test the robustness of KED to derive bathymetry in a multitemporal series of Sentinel-2 images and multibeam data, and 3) to compare the performance of KED against the existing non-spatial models described by Stumpf et al. and Lyzenga. Results showed that KED could improve prediction accuracy with a decrease in RMSE of 89{\%} and 88{\%}, and an increase in R2 of 27{\%} and 14{\%}, over the Stumpf and Lyzenga models, respectively. The decrease in RMSE provides a worthwhile improvement in accuracy, where results showed effective prediction of depth up to 6 m. However, the presence of higher concentrations of suspended materials, especially river plumes, can reduce this threshold to 4 m. As would be expected, prediction accuracy could be improved through the removal of outliers, which were mainly located in the channel of the river, areas influenced by the river plume, abrupt topography, but also very shallow areas close to the shoreline. These areas have been identified as conflictive zones where satellite-derived bathymetry can be compromised.},
