A Python Jupyter notebook toolbox for interactive surface water mapping using Google 
Earth Engine.

## Introduction
PyGEE-SWToolbox is Python-Google Earth Engine (GEE) Surface Water Analyzer toolbox developed
 in Jupyter notebook for interactive surface water mapping using the GEE cloud computing 
 platform. Conventional use of the GEE platform requires the user to able to write 
 JavaScript codes in the GEE online Code Editor or the use of Python codes using the 
 Python API to perform geospatial processing of datasets. This toolbox provides a graphical 
 user interface (GUI) for surface water analysis and visualiztion without the user writing 
 a single line of code. The GUI was developed using ipyleaflet and ipywidgets. The toolbox 
 relies on the <b>GEE Python API, geemap, geetools, eemont, and hydrafloods</b> packages.
