A Python Jupyter notebook toolbox for interactive surface water mapping using 
Google Earth Engine. 

## Introduction
PyGEE-SWToolbox is Python-Google Earth Engine (GEE) Surface Water Analyzer toolbox
developed in Jupyter notebook for interactive surface water mapping using the GEE cloud 
computing platform. Conventional use of the GEE platform requires the user to able to write
JavaScript codes in the GEE online Code Editor or the use of Python codes using the Python 
API to perform geospatial processing of datasets. This toolbox provides a graphical user
interface (GUI) for surface water analysis and visualiztion without the user writing a 
single line of code. The GUI was developed using ipyleaflet and ipywidgets.
